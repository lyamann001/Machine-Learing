Algorithms:


1.Simple Linear Regression :
Coefficient: 38.86 ,
Intercept: 125.76

2.Multiple Linear Regression : 
Multiple regression is like linear regression, but with more than one independent value, meaning that we try to predict a value based on two or more 
result: Variance Score : 0.87

3.Content Based:
In this study, we will try to make a movie recommendation to the user by creating a user profile according to the rating rates given to the movies by the users and creating a weight matrix according to the types of the movies.


4.Collobarotive Filtering:
In this study, by detecting the similarity between the movies rated by the user and the users who have already scored the same movies in the database

5.KNN:
In this study, we will try to estimate the most suitable package for the new user by classifying the existing users according to 4 different customer packages of a telecom company.

6.Decision Tree:

In this study, we will try to determine the best treatment that can be applied to a new patient by building a model on a dataset that includes patients' responses to different drugs. The aim is to determine the drug that will give the best treatment by applying very little testing to the new patient.

7.K-Mean Clustering:
k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster
